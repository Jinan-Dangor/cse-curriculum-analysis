The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application.\nThe course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces.

At the undergraduate level it is generally considered to be too onerous, and to much of a distraction, to be worth the effort; and it does make higher-than-average mathematical demands on students. Its application to industrial-strength systems requires specialised software tools operated by highly trained software analysts.\n(In-)Formal Methods (intended to be a provocative title) is the collection of program structuring- and design principles that are based on and justified by Formal Methods \u2014 but because Formal Methods has its reputation of being difficult and esoteric, the principles are largely ignored. In spite of their being known and understood by specialists for 40 years, it is rare to find an undergraduate course in which they are taught. As a result, programmers of average aptitude produce code of a very low standard. (Programmers of high natural aptitude discover their own versions of some of these principles for themselves \u2014 eventually.)\nThus this proposal \u2013in its first component\u2013 is to introduce the mathematically justified principles of program structure in the style of \u201cadvanced programming techniques\u201d but without the emphasis on theory that typically dooms Formal Methods courses to small specialised audiences. Good students will find their intuitions justified, and (some) will be stimulated to look into the material more deeply; average students will improve their programming skills significantly.\nThe second component of the course will focus on two up-to-date system paradigms specifically: randomised algorithms and secure computation. The emphasis will be on how the principles set out in the first half of the course can be extended to these more specialised topics.\nMore able students completing the course will be positioned to study Formal Methods (itself) more deeply, a career trajectory that leads to very highly regarded (and -paid) jobs in industry where computer-system correctness is at a premium. Furthermore, the methods apply equally to hardware as they do to software.\nIt is disjoint from existing courses on formal-methods tools because it doesn\u2019t rely heavily on software tools; it is disjoint from existing courses on (random) algorithms, and on security  because it is not an introduction to those topics per se but rather concentrated on the programming principles that should accompany them.", "Delivery Attributes": "", "Course Type": "Award course", "Course Attributes": "", "Repeat for Credit": "No"}, {"Course Code": "COMP6733", "Course Name": "Internet of Things Experimental Design Studio", "Course Name - SiMs": "Internet of Things", "Owning Faculty": "Faculty of Engineering", "Owning Academic Unit": "School of Computer Science and Engineering", "Collaborating Academic Unit": "", "Administrative Campus": "Sydney", "Units of Credit": "6", "Grading Basis": "Standard UNSW grades", "Academic Calendar Type": "3+", "Career": "Undergraduate\nPostgraduate", "Course Description for Handbook": "Internet of Things (IoT) will play a key role in the next frontier of computing.
